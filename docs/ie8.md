# IE8 issues

## High priority

<del>- Include jQuery and it goes to shit</del>
- Dynamically change "create milestone" to "save" for first run in IE8 - then refresh should yeild a checksum
- Processor menus don't appear
- Restored panels always maximise
<del>- Layout of profile when logged in wrong</del>

## Low

- Tablular column layout issue for urls (not the shortcuts though)
- Resizing windows doesn't work
