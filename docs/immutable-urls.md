```text
                  <-- development time -->

commit:         abc1    abc2    abc3      STAGE (local)
alias:                          HEAD
alias/alt:                      <blank>
```

Notes:

- commits are immutable
- stage is local changes, saved locally but not available to others

## JS Bin Grammar

- revision = commit
- latest   = HEAD
- <blank>  = <blank> = HEAD
- local changes = STAGE
