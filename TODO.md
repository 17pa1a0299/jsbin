# JS Bin V: TODO

## In progress

- [ ] Sign in (API, JWT)
- [x] Welcome

## Need for live

- [ ] Login
- [ ] Pay/cancel/renew
- [ ] Embeds work
- [ ] Secure output
- [x] Processors

## Bit bugs

- [ ] Linking to an existing url (https://v5.jsbin.com/gist/07ba1ea3d53decd293f49e543894c938) for the first time gives me the welcome page, then I lose the link
- [ ] Open a bin with CSS + JS and it doesn't include that in the initial render
- [ ] Change settings, and in other panel change a setting and original settings are lost
- [x] If console is open by default, then it takes focus
- [x] New is broken
- [x] Open is broken / Palette is broken
- [x] Make title a prop of Head, rather than multiple `title` els
- [x] Handle 404 - and for missing /local/* entries
- [x] Sticky quick setting layout
- [x] Quick commands aren't saving
- [x] Change theme from palette doesn't save (because it toggles to unknown value)

## Themes

- [ ] Dark loading gif
- [x] Dark welcome/document theme

## Console

- [x] Can the code be run without a try/catch closure to expose the `const`? (no, tested)
- [x] Console!
- [x] Errors need to be passed into console too

## Settings

- [x] Dark theme for .Error
- [x] Check default panel from 'app.source'
- [x] Ensure dirty flag is always picked up
- [x] If undefined command is selected in the palette, it breaks
- [x] Inject live across all tabs
- [x] Tests defaults work in App view
- [x] Support option injection via the "quick settings"
- [x] Fix/change? references to "vertical"

## Larger tasks

- [ ] Embeds (support existing urls - or potentially use embed.js to redirect to different url)
- [x] Processors
- [ ] Reinstate mobile mirror and mobile support (touch based, not keyboard)

## UI

- [ ] Share box
- [ ] Some kind of notification system
- [ ] Add meta data box
- [x] Loading gif
- [x] Import light + dark theme by default
- [x] Completely dark theme
- [x] Console
- [x] Restore cursor position on insert
- [x] Snippets and snippets from local bins

## UX

- [x] Protect keybindings (ref [#3035](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/3035))
- [ ] Support shortcuts (based on lib/commands.js)
- [ ] cmd+enter - run code with alerts, etc
- [ ] Investigate using blobs with scripts for real-time line number reports
- [ ] unfurl - can this even work if there's no dynamic server side?

## Lib

- [ ] Compile output document in web worker
- [ ] Inject CSS, don't recompile

## Pages

- [ ] Account
- [x] Settings (json like, ala VS Code)

## API

- [x] Import from gists
- [x] Export gist (currently anon onlyâ€¦)
- [ ] Save online/share
- [ ] Sync settings
- [ ] Login / upgrade, etc

## To be categorised

- [ ] Help

## Known issues

- [ ] When output is too big, it can't be scrolled vertically?

## Nice to have

- [ ] Hold cmd and hover over keyword, it underlines, and clicking opens a sub panel below the line of code to http://docs.devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/arraybuffer.html




# The Remy User

Why build JS Bin V at all?

## 1. I want to be able to try some code out and throw it away (out of mind).

This is achieve through local saving and potentially clearing my local browser cache.

## 2. I want to be able to help other people with their code.

I want to save a few steps from start of their code to the final code design and include notes on why I made changes.

## 3. I want to practice coding and pull it up later in time.

I should be able to tag or describe a bin to find it again. Perhaps use code snippets to search, or have some visual way to find bins again - perhaps highlight a specific line? #metadata
