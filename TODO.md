# TODO

# v3 alpha - hitlist

# Logo

- Hire and pay (unless they donate) to get a flipping logo. The crappy orange/black thing is lame Mr Sharp.

# URLs

/ref http://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/6859356800/

- /latest is fixed - not redirected
- If I'm on /latest, any new updates, notify me and I can reload/live refresh if I want
- Rewind? Possibly not.

# Panels

- Options for pre-rendering
- .getCode runs through panel language
- "insertionPoint" means we can have more panels
- Horizontal/Vertical switching affects code panels only - this will make the implementation MUCH easier

# Save

- Allow users to get full history of their bins: http://jsbin.tumblr.com/post/9252788402/saving-your-history-beta-one-of-the-beta
- History should read user login ---- TODO create branch for this
- Add gist support back in (but do it server side) - support Lea's dabblet format (but files named jsbin.html, etc)
- Fork (as well as clone) and folk allows me to trace this heirachy of bins saved to get to this point

# Misc

- Include analytics for dynamic nature of JS Bin
- Libs need to support styles, etc specific to the version
