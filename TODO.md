# TODO

# v3 alpha - hitlist

- Close buttons should be only clickable part - not the `<p>` tag

# URLs

- /latest is fixed - not redirected
- If I'm on /latest, any new updates, notify me and I can reload/live refresh if I want

# Panels

- Options for pre-rendering
- .getCode runs through panel language
- Close is a single element, and not the p element
- If no visible panels to the left, the splitter must be hidden

# Menus

- Click to open dropdown from split button
- History should read user login ---- TODO create branch for this

# Misc

- Include analytics for dynamic nature of JS Bin
